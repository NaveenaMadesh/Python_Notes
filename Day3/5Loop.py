# # loop --> loops in python is used to repeat an action over period of time
# # types of loop --> for ,while
# # for loop --> if we know fixed number of times to loop
# # while --> when we dont know how many times to repeat

# #syntax for for loop:
# #  for i in range (start,stop,step):
# start and step are optional
# for i in range(2,10,1)
# python wont include 10 2 to 9
for i in range(1,10,1):
    print(i)

#default start value --> 0 
# default step value -->1

for i in range (50,0,-1):
    print(i)

# for i in range(50,0):
#     print(i) --> wont print anything because the default step value is positive one
