# The Key Concept
# When you use a negative step, you're telling Python to go backwards through the sequence.
# Basic Syntax
# pythonsequence[start:stop:step]
# How Negative Step Works
# The crucial thing to remember: When step is negative, you need to think in reverse:

# start should be at a HIGHER index than stop
# You're moving from RIGHT to LEFT

# Let me show you with examples:
# pythontext = "ABCDEFGH"
# #       01234567  (positive indices)
# #       -8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  (negative indices)

# # Going BACKWARDS with step -1
# print(text[7:2:-1])   # "HGFED" - starts at index 7, stops before 2, goes backward
# print(text[::-1])     # "HGFEDCBA" - reverses entire string!
# print(text[5::-1])    # "FEDCBA" - from index 5 to beginning, backward

# # Going BACKWARDS with step -2 (skip every other)
# print(text[7:2:-2])   # "HFD" - takes every 2nd character going backward
# print(text[::-2])     # "HFDB" - every 2nd character, reversed
# Mental Model
# Think of it like this:
# Positive step (+1, +2, etc.):

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è Running forward (left to right)
# Start < Stop

# Negative step (-1, -2, etc.):

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è Running backward (right to left)
# Start > Stop (or use defaults)

# Common Patterns
# pythonlst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# lst[::-1]      # Reverse entire list: [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
# lst[5:2:-1]    # From 5 down to 3: [5,4,3]
# lst[-1:-5:-1]  # Last 4 items reversed: [9,8,7,6]
# lst[8:2:-2]    # From 8 to 3, step -2: [8,6,4]
# The "Aha!" Moment
# The stop index still works the same way - you stop BEFORE reaching it, whether going forward or backward:

# [2:5:1] ‚Üí stops before index 5
# [5:2:-1] ‚Üí stops before index 2

# Does this make sense now? Try thinking: "If step is negative, I'm walking backwards, so my starting point needs to be further right than where I'm stopping!"RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Ngive some exercises I will try to answer !!!!EditGreat!

# Let me explain the ones you got wrong:
# #6: numbers[6::-1] ‚Üí [6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
# Your thinking: Default stop is end of sequence (index 9), which is greater than start.
# Reality: When step is negative and stop is omitted, Python uses -1 as the default stop (meaning "go all the way to the beginning"). So it goes from index 6 backwards to the start!
# Think of it as: numbers[6:None:-1] which means "from 6, go backwards to the beginning"

# #7: numbers[:3:-1] ‚Üí [9,8,7,6,5,4]
# Your thinking: Default start is 0, which is smaller than stop.
# Reality: When step is negative and start is omitted, Python uses None as default start, which means "start from the end". So it starts at index 9, goes backward, and stops BEFORE index 3.
# Think of it as: numbers[9:3:-1] or "from the end, go backwards until you reach (but don't include) index 3"

# #8: numbers[-2:2:-1] ‚Üí [8,7,6,5,4,3]
# Your thinking: Start should be greater than stop (you got the rule right!)
# Reality: -2 IS greater than 2! Remember:

# -2 = index 8 (the number 8)
# Stop at index 2 (before the number 2)
# So: start at 8, go backward, stop before 2
# Result: [8,7,6,5,4,3]

# The negative index -2 translates to position 8, which IS greater than position 2! ‚ú®

# Key Takeaway:
# When step is negative:

# Omitted start ‚Üí defaults to "end of sequence" (start from the right)
# Omitted stop ‚Üí defaults to "beginning of sequence" (go all the way left)
# Negative indices still count from the end, but then you compare their actual positions!

# You did really well! The tricky ones caught you, but that's exactly where the learning happens! Want to try a few more, or do you feel solid now? üí™RetryNReality: -2 IS greater than 2! Remember:
# * meaning you says python in built converts the negative index to positive then it converts uh?? I thought in number line modelEditAh! You're absolutely right to question this! Let me clarify - this is an important distinction! üéØ
# What Python Actually Does:
# YES! Python converts negative indices to their positive equivalents first, then evaluates the slice.
# pythonnumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# #                                 ‚Üë
# #                              index -2 = index 8

# numbers[-2:2:-1]
# # Step 1: Convert -2 to positive ‚Üí -2 becomes 8
# # Step 2: Now it's numbers[8:2:-1]
# # Step 3: Is 8 > 2? YES! So go backward from 8 to 2
# # Result: [8,7,6,5,4,3]
# Your "Number Line Model" Confusion:
# You might have been thinking:

# On a number line: -2 < 2 (negative two is less than positive two)
# But that's NOT how Python thinks about it!

# Python thinks in positions in the list:

# -2 ‚Üí "2nd position from the end" ‚Üí position 8
# 2 ‚Üí "position 2"
# Position 8 > Position 2? YES!

# The Mental Model:
# Think of negative indices as shortcuts that Python immediately translates:
# Index:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
# Value:    [0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9]
# Negative: -10 -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

# -2 is just another way to say 8
# -5 is just another way to say 5
# So numbers[-2:2:-1] is literally the same as numbers[8:2:-1] after Python does the conversion.
# Does this clear it up?
# Python doesn't care about negative vs positive numbers mathematically - it only cares about which position in the list you're pointing to!
# So forget the number line - think "position in the list" instead! üìç
