# remove(value)--> removes by value 
# pop(index)--> removes by index(position)

# remove(value)
# How it works:
# searches through the list for the value
# Removes the first occurence of that value
# Doesnt return anything (return None)
# Raises error iff values not found

'''pop(index)'''

# Goes directly to that IndexErrorRemoves the item at that position
#Removes the item at that position
# Returns the removed item
# If no index given removes last item
